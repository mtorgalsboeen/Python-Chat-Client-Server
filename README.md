# Python Chat program (Includes both Client and Server)

This is created for a school homework in Computer Networks. There are to clients that are going to chat, Bob and Alice. 

## Getting Started

Download the files (Server.py and Client.py) 
- Then run the server, now the server is waiting for the clients to connect.
- Now run the client.py, and write the user (Either Bob or Alice.)
- Now run another client.py and write the other user (Opposite of the one you wrote in the first client.py.)

- Now you have an open connection between the clients and you can simply chat. 

Type "Bye" in one of the client windows to close the clients & server.
